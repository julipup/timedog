## Work in progress

There are no documentation, no guides, no pre-built apks and even no interface and functionality in this application.

## How to run locally

First of all, you'll need to install Android Studio and rust. I hope you can do it yourself :>

*P.S.* You'll need to install tauri-mobile for this project to work: [how to install](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-mobile#installation)

`npm run install` - Installing npm deps     
`cargo mobile init` - Initializing tauri-mobile project     
`npm run ui:build` - Building interface     
`cargo android run` - Building, bundling and running application on locally connected *(or emulated)* device
